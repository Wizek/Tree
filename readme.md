# Introduction
## Why?
I got fed up with QUnit which I was using to test the client side of one of my projects. It proved to be very unreliable when it came to async handling. I looked around for alternatives and to my surprise, I couldn't find anything more satisfying than what I was already using. Then came the idea: What if I'd write my own Unit Testing framework for JavaScript?

## How?
- I should be able to trust it -- it needs to operate in a stable and reliable manner.
- It should have all the benefits of the frameworks I've already tried, with some addition I've always missed.
- It should look gorgeous, as I'll be looking at it a whole lot of times.

## What?
I didn't want to do it first, but I liked the vision so much on how it all will come together that after a while I've been dragged in and built **Tree.js**.

- Trust: It's an unit-tested Unit Testing framework. You can check out the tests in the test folder, and run them if you will. If you still manage to find a bug in spite all this effort, I'd love to pull your proposed test cases/asserts maybe along with the fixed code itself.
- Functionality: See highlights below.
- Look & Feel:

# Current highlights
> `✓` (cross) marks completed feature.<br>
> `•` (dot) means work in progress/partially done.<br>
> `_` (empty/underscore) means planned/proposed feature, which awaits sedulous hands.

 - `✓` Works in the browser
 	- `✓` Works in AMD environment
 	- `✓` Works with script tags too
 - `_` Works with Node.js `// shouldn't be hard to implement.`
 - `✓` Handles async code as never before
 	- `✓` Assert counting
 	- `✓` Easily go back and forth between
 		- `✓` Parallel execution
 		- `✓` Serial execution
 - `✓` Expressive syntax
 - `✓` Looks wonderful in the browser
 	- `✓` Only shows you those asserts that require your attention, and doesn't bother you with the rest. But you can browse them too, if you ever wanted.
 - `•` Looks.. Nice in the console.
 	- `_` You can choose how verbose you want it to be
 - `✓` Write as little as you want with the least effort
 - `✓` Organize as much as you want into a tree, e.g., for following the structure of your app
 - `•` Many more!

# Quick Start Guide
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Wizek/Tree/downloads).
This is all the markup you are going to need (if you use good old script tags):

```html
<!doctype html>
<!-- jQuery won't be a dependency for long -->
<script src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/tree.js"></script>
<body></body>
<script type="text/javascript">
	tree(1).is(2)
	tree.done(1)
</script>
```
When you run this, of course, it's gonna fail, because `1 === 2` is false.

Let's grow a branch! (html markup is the same, only writing js part)

```javascript
tree.branch('Name of the branch', function(tree) {
	tree(1).is(2)
	tree.done(1)
})
tree.done(0)
```

Let's do that 2 more times.

```javascript
tree.branch('Name of the first outer branch', function(tree) {
	tree.branch('Name of the one inside the first outer branch', function(tree) {
		tree(23).type(number)
		tree.done(1)
	})
	tree.done(0)
})
tree.branch('Name of the second outer one', function(tree) {
	tree(1).not.is(2)
	tree.done(1)
})
tree.done(0)
```

Did you notice that you can declare branches within another branch? This helps you to organize your tests into a tree (hence the name Tree.js). It has neat output too!

That should be enough to get you started. For more see "*Reference guide*" below.

# Reference guide (WIP)
## Three (3) loading modes supported!
### Browser: Traditional
```html
<!-- jQuery won't be a dependency for long -->
<script src="path/to/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/tree.js"></script>
<script> /* ... */ </script>
```
### Browser: AMD
```html
<script>
require(['tree'], function(tree) {
	/* ... */
})
</script>
```
### Node.js: require (WIP)
```javascript
var tree = require('path/to/tree.js')
/* ... */
```
## Asserts
### Strict (triple) equal `a === b`
```javascript
tree('foo').is('foo') // passes
tree(1).is('1') // fails
tree(1).is(2) // fails
```
### Loose (double) equal `a == b`
```javascript
tree('foo').is('foo') // passes
tree(1).is('1') // passes
tree(1).is(2) // fails
```
### Truthy `!! a`
```javascript
tree('foo').ok() // passes
tree(0).ok() // fails
tree(null).ok() // fails
```
### Type `typeof a === b` + some magic
```javascript
tree('str').type('string') // passes
tree(function(){}).type('function') // passes
tree(1).type('string') // fails
tree([]).type('array') // yep, this passes
```
### Always passing assert - Doesn't take arguments.
```javascript
tree().pass() // passes
```
### Always failing assert - Doesn't take arguments.
```javascript
tree().fail() // fails
```
### Check for exception
```javascript
var Fn1 = function(){throw new Error()}
var Fn2 = function(){}
tree(Fn1).throws() // passes
tree(Fn2).throws() // fails
```
### Deep equal - compare two objects and their properties recursively
```javascript
tree([1,2]).deepEql([1,2]) // passes
tree({a:1,b:[22,33]}).deepEql({a:1,b:[22,33]}) // passes
tree({a:1,b:[22,33]}).deepEql({a:1,b:[22,34]}) // fails
```
## Negation `!`
You can use `.not.` on any assert to negate their result.

```javascript
tree('123').not.is(123) // passes
tree(function(){}).not.throws() // passes
tree('123').not.like(123) // fails
```
## Branching
Organize your asserts into a nice tree

```javascript
tree.branch('Name these', function(tree) {
	tree.branch('whatever', function(tree) {
		/* ... */
	})
	tree.branch('you', function(tree) {
		tree.branch('want!', function(tree) {
			/* ... */
		})
		/* ... */
	})
	/* ... */
})
```
## Async handling
### Assert count
```javascript
tree.branch('this branch passes', function(tree){
	tree.done(0)
})
tree.branch('this passes too', function(tree){
	tree(true).ok()
	tree.done(1)
})
tree.branch('this fails', function(tree){
	tree(true).ok()
	tree(true).ok()
	tree.done(1)
})
// If you want to be more explicit you can also use tree.expect(\d)
// to say how many asserts you expect to run within the current branch
tree.branch('more explicit expect', function(tree){
	tree.expect(1)
	tree(true).ok()
	tree.done()
})
tree.done(0)
```
### Serial execution by default
```javascript
tree.branch(function(tree) {
	// executes 1st
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 3rd
		tree.done(0)
	}, 100)
	// executes 2nd
})
tree.branch(function(tree) {
	// executes 4th
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 6th
		tree.done(0)
	}, 100)
	// executes 5th
})
// starts execution
tree.done(0)
```
### Set parallel execution
```javascript
tree.heritable.config({parallel:true})
tree.branch(function(tree) {
	// executes 1st
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 5th
		tree.done(0)
	}, 100)
	// executes 2nd
})
tree.branch(function(tree) {
	// executes 3rd
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 6th
		tree.done(0)
	}, 200)
	// executes 4th
})
// starts execution
tree.done(0)
```
### Switch between parallel/serial on the fly with .waitForDone() and .fireNextToo()
```javascript
tree.heritable.config({parallel:true})
tree.branch('waiter', function(tree) {
	tree.waitForDone()
	// executes 2nd
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 4th
		tree.done(0)
	}, 100)
	// executes 3rd
})
tree.branch('rusher', function(tree) {
	tree.fireNextToo()
	// executes 5th
	setTimeout(function() {
		// executes 8th
		tree.done(0)
	}, 100)
	// executes 6th
})
tree.branch('whatever', function(tree) {
	// executes 7th
	tree.done(0)
})
// executesn 1st
tree.done(0)
```
### Timeout handling
Each branch has exaclty 1000 milliseconds by default to signal their finish with `tree.done()`. Should they time out they are considered failing. Default timeout value can be changed with `tree.cfg('timeout', value)`

```javascript
tree.branch("I'm in time :)", function(tree) {
	tree.waitForDone()
	setTimeout(function() {
		tree.done(0)
	}, 600)
})
tree.branch('I time out :(', function(tree) {
	setTimeout(function() {
		tree.done(0)
	}, 1200)
})
tree.branch("I take very long to run but it's normal.", function(tree) {
	tree.config({timeout:3000})
	setTimeout(function() {
		tree.done(0)
	}, 2600)
})
// executes 1st
tree.done(0)
```
